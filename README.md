=================
Dec 2014 - Updated app for ios7/8. Corrected a number of warnings for depreciated framework calls, moved screen redraw logic from 'viewwill..' to 'layout..' events (the correct approach for ios7/8).

Jan 2015 - Moved app from BT SVN repository into BT Github (due to known issues with OSX/Xcode/SVN). Client and developers can now work easily completely within Xcode.

Feb 2015 - Moved application name from BT apple developer account to APS apple developer account.
